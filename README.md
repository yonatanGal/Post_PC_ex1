# Mini Interactions
Exercise to implement tiny interactions when user taps a button

## To implement the needed parts:

1. clone the repository
2. take a look at file activity_edit_title.xml to see all sub-views in the screen.
3. take a look at file EditTitleActivity.java to see screen logic, and implement all TODOs in this file

## Common errors:

If you face a "Failed to install the following Android SDK packages as some licences have not been accepted"
You should install the "Google Licensing library". To do that:
1. In the top left go to "Tools" --> "sdk manager"
2. Select tab "SDK Tools"
3. check a V on the "Google Licensing library" checkbox
4. click Apply and wait for install to finish
5. click OK
